# Henry comments 13/April
- Still no SIDs in this file. (Reply : Done)
- Not enough commits + changelog items to pass at this frequency. (Reply : Uploaded more changes and updated changelog file)
- I couldn't find your text-based data. Create a root folder "data/" and put all your JSON files in there. (Reply : Adding json files in assets folder)
- You're still missing a licenses.txt file.  (Reply : Done) 

# Henry comments 27/April
- I haven't seen any updates in quite a few days  (We were facing issues with some crashes and game load for level 2 changes, fixed some issues and commited)
- your changelog needs a lot more work (Updated, will be updating more in next few days)
- Your data hasn't progressed enough given that we're at the end of Week 7. (Modifying the data set and fixing few issues. Will have more commits today and tomorrow).

The Game Recording is present in the app folder along with changelog, license document and license attribution and readme text files. Marking justification document is also present in same folder.

The game recording video is slightly more than 5 mins. Since i was having trouble with audio voice recording with too much disturbance i have shown the text on document along with the demo.
